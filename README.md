# Digit Recognizer

## Features
In my research, I study the following classification algorithms:
- Logistic Regression
- K Nearest Neighbours (KNN)
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting
- Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

See the [research.ipynb](research.ipynb) file for details.

I use CNN in my application for digit recognition:
